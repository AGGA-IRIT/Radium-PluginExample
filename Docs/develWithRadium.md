# How to code in Radium

There are three main options to work with Radium:
1. Write a plugin: full access to the Radium data structures, perfect to implement a new fonctionality: mesh processing, rendering.
2. Write an application: give total control over the GUI, the camera settings, etc...
3. Contribute to Radium libraries: to improve/extend core components of Radium.
